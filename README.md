This app is an Option A - BC Liquor app.

This app is different than the basic version as it incorporates the following features: 
1) Incorporation of an IMAGE (BC Liquor emblem) + an emoji! 
2) Added a COUNTRY FILTER with DROP-DOWN options allowing for functionality such as: SELECT ALL, ADDING MUTLIPLE COUNTRIES, DESELECT etc. 
3) Added a DENSITY DISTRIBUTION layer to the histogram and added colors to ggplot to embellish
