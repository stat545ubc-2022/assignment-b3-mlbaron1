This app is an Option A - BC Liquor app.

This app is different than the basic version as it incorporates the following features: 
1) Incorporation of an IMAGE (BC Liquor emblem) + an emoji! 
2) Added a COUNTRY FILTER with DROP-DOWN options allowing for functionality such as: SELECT ALL, ADDING MUTLIPLE COUNTRIES, DESELECT etc. 
3) Added a DENSITY DISTRIBUTION layer to the histogram and added colors to ggplot to embellish

This app is Option C & starting a new shiny app from scratch. 
The purpose of this app is to showcase work that I do to a semi-informed linguistic audience. 
The app describes the research project and demonstrates the paradigm using relavant imagery, sound, and interactive plot visualizations. There is text which helps guide the reader through the research.

The following features were adopted by this app: 
1) Soundfiles which are interactable (you may play and download the sounds). 
2) Relevant imagery.
3) Functional email link to contact me at.
4) Interactive ggplot ellipse visualization demonstrating the vowel mappings in F1-F2 space to illustrate where the vowels are mapped. 
5) pickerInput widget to interact with visualization to select high vowels vs non-high vowels to demonstrate the main effect seen in the study.
