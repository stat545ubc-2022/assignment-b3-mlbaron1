This app is an Option A - BC Liquor app.

This app is different than the basic version as it incorporates the following features: 
1) Incorporation of an IMAGE (BC Liquor emblem) + an emoji! 
2) Added a COUNTRY FILTER with DROP-DOWN options allowing for functionality such as: SELECT ALL, ADDING MUTLIPLE COUNTRIES, DESELECT etc. 
3) Added a DENSITY DISTRIBUTION layer to the histogram and added colors to ggplot to embellish

Click on the following link to view my shiny app on the web: 
https://z2rq7c-michelle-kamigaki0baron.shinyapps.io/vowel_chart/

This app is Option C & starting a new shiny app from scratch. 

Criteria:
The following features were adopted by this app: 
1) Soundfiles which are interactable (you may play and download the sounds). 
2) Relevant images.
3) Functional email link to contact me at.
4) Interactive ggplot ellipse visualization demonstrating the vowel mappings in F1-F2 space to illustrate where the vowels are mapped in the study. 
5) pickerInput widget to interact with visualization to select high vowels vs non-high vowels to demonstrate the main effect seen in the study. 

App design:
The purpose of this app is to showcase work that I do to a semi-informed linguistic audience. 

About the app:
The app guides the viewer through a research study on Secwepmcstin vowels. Viewers are introduced to the topic, listen to the vowels, read about the study, and finally interact with the results found in the study.
